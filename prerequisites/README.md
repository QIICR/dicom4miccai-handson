# Prerequisites

In this tutorial we will use several open source software tools, and publicly available datasets.

Many of the tools we install here will be helpful to you in the future when you work with DICOM, so think about this as setting up your lab space for the future work!

We prepared packages with the binaries of some of the tools that are largest in size \(to reduce reliance on the network\) for each of the platforms. Those are linked from this page together with the platform-specific installation instructions. The list of the tools we will be using is provided in the Details section.

## Prerequisites that you will need to install on your own

Some of the components of the tutorial will utilize:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/), various python packages available via `pip install`
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

You will need to have Python environment, pip, and Jupyter Notebook available on your computer to follow those components of the tutorial.
