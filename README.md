# DICOM4MICCAI: 21st Century DICOM for Quantitative Imaging Research: Why, What and How

**Materials for the MICCAI 2017 tutorial taking place on Sept 10, 2017**

**More info at [http://qiicr.org/dicom4miccai](http://qiicr.org/dicom4miccai)**

These materials were prepared to accompany the hands-on component of the [DICOM4MICCAI tutorial at the MICCAI 2017 conference](http://qiicr.org/dicom4miccai/).

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the basic concepts related to the use of the DICOM standard for storing quantitative image analysis results, and the tools that you may find helpful to work with the resulting datasets.

The tutorial is organized into the following sections:

1. [Prerequisites](gitbook/prerequisites.md)
2. [DICOM for storing analysis results](gitbook/dicom-slicer.md)
3. [Exploration of the analysis results stored in DICOM](gitbook/dicom-explore.md)
