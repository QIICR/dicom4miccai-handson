## Step 3: Segment lesions

We will use the `QuantitativeReporting` for the subsequent steps to annotate the loaded PET SUV image with the segmentations of the lesions, and to calculate segmentation-based measurements.

Select the `QuantitativeReporting` module in the module selector. You can click the magnifying glass icon to the left of the module selector and start typing the module name to quickly locate it. 

Follow the steps below to familiarize yourself with the user interface of the `QuantitativeReporting` module and complete the segmentation.
