### Segment the lesions

Various segmentation tools are available, from basic manual contouring, to thresholding and more advanced automated tools.

For segmenting the lesion in PET, we will use a specialized automated tool presented by Beichel et al in [this manuscript](http://dx.doi.org/10.1118/1.4948679).

To segment a PET lesion using this tool, first enable it from the list of segmentation tools, and then click within the primary lesion region in the axial slice.
