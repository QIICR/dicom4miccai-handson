# Using DICOM to store your analysis results

In this section of the tutorial we will cover some of the open source tools that can be used to generate standard DICOM representation for some of the data types encountered in imaging research. Specifically, we will focus on image segmentations, and measurements derived from those segmentations \(radiomics features being an example of such derived measurements\).
