# Step 5: Reload the segmentations from DICOM

You can close the MITK application and open it again to start fresh.

To reload the segmentations you created in the previous steps, simply open the "DICOM Browser", select the SEG series for the subject QIN-HEADNECK-01-0024, and load it. You can load the original PET series as well.

After you click "View" in the "DICOM Browser", you will be prompted about loading the referenced series.
